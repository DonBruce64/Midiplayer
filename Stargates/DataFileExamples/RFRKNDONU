Dimension Name: Artania
Dimension Theme: Dead world
Creator(s): 
Gamemode: Survival

Description:
Constant darkness, snow, and
lack of light makes this world
quite hazardous. Few landmarks
exist on the surface, meaning
players will need to rely on
their survival skills to avoid
an early grave. Although poor
for navigation, the flat terrain
is well-suited to rail and air.
